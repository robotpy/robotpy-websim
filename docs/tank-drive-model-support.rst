Tank Drive Model Support
========================

 .. note:: The equations used in our :class:`TankModel` is derived from
           `Noah Gleason and Eli Barnett's motor characterization whitepaper
           <https://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/3402>`_. It is
           recommended that users of this model read the paper so they can
           more fully understand how this works.
           
           In the interest of making progress, this API may receive
           backwards-incompatible changes before the start of the 2019
           FRC season.
